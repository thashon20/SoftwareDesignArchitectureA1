# SoftwareDesignArchitectureA1

Welcome to our Software Design and Architecture Assignment 1

This file will explain how we went about reaching our deliverables 

Our Deliverables require to make a Abstract Factory that will create a grocery item object 
This Object would be created and then taken into a Factory Method which would then redefine that object
This Object would be set to a selected factory by user and then enter into that factory
Once the factory is entered the data for that factory would be retrieved from a datalist text file
This would then output the information of that factory item selected and its price for that product 
We have allowed for 3 different objects to be created so that it can test numerous inputs and their outputs
We have went with the scheme of setting Apples as 1 , Bananas as 2 and Tomatoes as 3 
If any other integer number was entered it will output that this is an invalid factory   

Please take a look at the code and the comments as well and feel free to leave any comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated!
